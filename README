A little hack to effectively change the color of the UIStatusBar.

It actually just sets the status bar to "Transparent black style" and sets the 
background color of a UIView placed behind the status bar. Note that because
the Status Bar is black with alpha 0.5, the color that appears is quite a bit
darker than the UIColor.

You can get pretty close to the actual UIColor by using RGB colors instead 
of the UIColor constants.
